# Confirming Analysis

Data Analysis is often used to make educated guesses based on sample data. 

We might look at the Animals Dataset and try to draw conclusions about other animal shelters based on that sample. 

But if the sample doesn’t accurately represent the full population, those conclusions can be wrong —and sometimes, really, really wrong!
